                <p>
                    My name is Ebony, I am 32 and changing careers!! Exciting, I know ...<br>
                    Recently I returned from contracting overseas as a fueler for military aircrafts.<br>
                    While I was there I met A LOT of people from so many different backgrounds. I got to see a little of<br>
                    what everybody was working on and took note of it. What I discovered is that the IT guys had the most flexibility<br>
                    and the best pay ranges. What I love to do is travel and not be stationary, so IT sounded like my next career move!</p>
